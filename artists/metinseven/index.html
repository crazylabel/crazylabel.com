<P>
<DIV class="brand">Metin Seven</DIV> is born on the 23rd of july 1971 in Brussels, Belgium. During his childhood in the Netherlands Metin develops a predilection for expressive media, such as movies, music and comics.</P>

<h3>The Comics</h3>

<h3>Behind the scenes of the Seamour Sheep comic</h3>
<p>Once upon a time, a silly sheep called Seamour and a wiseacre mole called Marty lived on the vast grassy plains of Scotland, in a comic strip series that is. Seamour and Marty are the main characters in a comic that is completely created by using three-dimensional (3D) graphics techniques. While most comics are (still) drawn and colored using traditional two-dimensional (2D) techniques, the Seamour Sheep comic is constructed in a fully digital 3D environment. For those of you who are not familiar with the concept of 3D computer graphics I will try to explain it.<br>

<p>If you look at traditional creative media you can already distinguish 2D techniques from 3D techniques: drawing on paper or painting on a canvas is 2D, because it is practiced on a flat surface with two dimensions: width and length. If you want a drawing or painting to look 3D you'll have to manually create the illusion of realistic conditions such as correct perspective, lightfall, shadows, reflections, etcetera. However, you can also choose to create by using 3D media, such as clay, stone, wood, wax or anything that lends itself to be sculpted into a creative expression in three dimensions: width, length and depth. And to create an environment in 3D you can build a surrounding set, as they do for movies.
