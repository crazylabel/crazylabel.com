<p><div class="brand">Bubi Au Yeung </div> was born and raised in Hong Kong, where she worked as a multimedia designer by day and a passionate illustrator by night. For as long as she can remember, Bubi loved to draw, read all kinds of comic and illustrated books, and collect toys.
<p>From doodling on phone books as a child, Bubi's artistic skills have come a long way. She became a freelance illustrator in 2004, creating a series of illustrated short stories and characters. Including Treeson, who's borned under Bubi's magic strokes in 2005 and quickly became a fans' favorite around the world.</P>
<h3>Who is Treeson?</h3>
<span id="treesonimage"><img src="/images/treesonicon.gif" alt="Treeson" /></span>
<p>My name is Treeson, I stand taller than seated and I grow older every day. My body is a marshmallow, though sometimes it tastes like snow.<br>
<p>I used to have nothing in my chest. Then one day, a tree branch was stabbed into my heart ? don't worry, it doesn't hurt. I'm used to it now. Don't we all have something in out heart as we get older? I like my friends. I smile a lot. And I'm seldom bored. I am Treeson, the son of trees.
