<DIV class="brand">Peskimo</DIV> is one half David and one half Jodie. Together they have been creating characters and creatures to join them in their daily lives in the city of Bristol in the UK. After meeting at Uni and taking some time out to travel the world, they picked up their pens and haven't looked back since.

<p>Together, Peskimo have been creating characters for toys, animations, advertising and clothing for people like KidRobot, Sony, Barclays and Vodaphone as well as a whole host of people that you may not have heard of (but should do!) They find inspiration from cartoons, vintage graphic design, chocolate and overhearing people in the post office queue.</P>
<P>
They hope one day to have their own ice cream van.</P>
